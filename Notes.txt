1.
When we write 'const app = express()', express behinds the scene create server(i.e. const server = http.createServer(app)).
And so we wouldn't have access to 'server' varibale in 'const io = socketio(server)'.
That's why we manually created server.

2.
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js" /> is client side version of the library.
When we load thin in, our client side java code will have access to some stuffs to set up communication.
